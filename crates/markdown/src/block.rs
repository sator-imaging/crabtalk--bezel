//! Who paints a fenced block.
//!
//! A consumer that needs a block of its own — a chart, a diagram, an embed —
//! reaches for this rather than for a new [`crate::BlockKind`]. The vocabulary
//! stays closed because markdown is the wire form and a new kind would have to
//! own a syntax; a fence already has one. It round trips byte for byte, holds a
//! caret in [`crate::Part::Code`], and on a build that installs nothing it
//! paints the source it always did.
//!
//! The `mermaid` feature paints a ` ```mermaid ` fence the installed renderer
//! leaves, as a diagram.
//!
//! Installed once at boot like the highlighter, and read at paint.
