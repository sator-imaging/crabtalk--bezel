//! [`Doc`] → markdown.
//!
//! The guarantee is a **fixed point**: `parse(serialize(parse(s)))` equals
//! `parse(s)` for any input. An edit/save cycle can therefore never drift,
//! which is the property an editor actually needs — stronger than pretty
//! output and weaker (honestly so) than byte-identical round tripping, which a
//! flat model cannot promise for arbitrarily nested CommonMark.
//!
//! Escaping is deliberately narrow. Over-escaping is its own bug: escaping `#`
//! everywhere turns a `#123` reference into `\#123`, which no reader matches.
//! So `#`, `>`, `-` and friends are escaped only at the start of a line, where
//! they would actually mean something.
