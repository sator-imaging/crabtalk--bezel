//! Positions that outlive the edits under them.
//!
//! A comment or a highlight is anchored to a range of text, and that range has
//! to move when the text around it does. What it *says* — a thread's replies,
//! a highlight's note, who made either — is the app's, the way a link preview
//! is. What is here is the range, its wash, and what keeps it over the same
//! words.
//!
//! The anchors live in the editor rather than in the app because
//! [`crate::History`] restores whole-document snapshots: an undo has no delta to
//! map an anchor through, so the store has to sit where the history can carry
//! it back.
//!
//! Mapping follows the **left-sticky** rule the marks already follow
//! (`markdown::Text::insert`): text typed at the end of a range joins it, text
//! typed at the start does not. Both ends take the same arithmetic, so there is
//! no bias to pick per end and no second rule to keep in step with the first.
