//! How big a document is set, and the chords that nudge it.
//!
//! Two numbers, the way Xcode and Zed split them. The *base* is the app's, in
//! points: a settings field, handed to [`Editor::with_text_size`], and never
//! touched from in here. The *adjustment* is the reader's — what `cmd-+` moves,
//! shared by every open document, and held in memory only. A reset clears the
//! adjustment, and the base is what is left.
//!
//! Nothing here is persisted: storage is the app's, not a component library's.
//! The base comes from whatever settings the app keeps, and an app that wants
//! the adjustment to outlive the process stores [`crate::AppExt::editor_text_size_adjustment`]
//! beside it — beside, not folded into the base, or a reset has nowhere left
//! to return to.
//!
//! [`Editor::with_text_size`]: crate::Editor::with_text_size
