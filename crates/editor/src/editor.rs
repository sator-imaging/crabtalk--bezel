//! The editing surface.
//!
//! The document is the single source of truth. There is no `TextField` per
//! block: a selection is a pair of `Cursor`s into one `Doc`, which is what
//! makes Enter split, Backspace merge and Tab indent into list operations
//! rather than negotiations between separate widgets each owning a string.
//!
//! Everything about *what* an edit does lives in `markdown` — `edit` and
//! `select` — and is tested there without a window. This crate owns only what
//! needs one: a focus handle, key bindings, the platform input handler, and
//! turning a click into a position.
