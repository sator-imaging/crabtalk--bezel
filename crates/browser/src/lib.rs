//! A platform webview hosted in a gpui window.
//!
//! The page is a native view (WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows,
//! webkit2gtk on Linux) above gpui's own surface, not pixels gpui paints.
//! gpui paints under it, and gpui's content masks do not clip it. On the web
//! build, [`Frame`] is an `<iframe>` above the canvas, under the same limits.
