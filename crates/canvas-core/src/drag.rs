//! What dragging a node does — the app's call, per view.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! cx.new(|cx| CanvasView::new(doc, cx).with_drag(canvas::drag::reparent))
//! ```
//!
//! A handler answers each move and the drop with [`Change`]s. On a move its
//! `MoveNodes` are applied as they come, and the rest are drawn as what the
//! drop would do — a ring on a node an added edge reaches, the connector it
//! would make, the ones removed edges would cut. The drop is one batch through
//! the view's change filter, with the preview put back first, so a refused
//! drop leaves everything where it was. [`pin`], [`reparent`] and [`detach`]
//! are answers, not the list: an app writes its own with the same signature.
