//! The button — one component, three shipped looks — in its labelled and
//! glyph-only forms, the [`Buttons::control_group`] that gathers adjacent ones
//! onto one shared background, and [`Buttons::ghost`], the open frame a quiet
//! control paints around children of its own. A catalog trait like every widget
//! group: `use ui::widgets::{ButtonStyle, Buttons};` →
//! `theme.button("Save", ButtonStyle::Prominent, None)`.
//!
//! [`ButtonStyle`] is a closed enum, not free-form knobs: it selects between
//! the looks that ship, while per-call overrides stay chain modifiers.
