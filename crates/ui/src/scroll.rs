//! What gpui's own scroll handles leave to the app: a container that scrolls
//! the way it was asked to, a bar to show the position, and a rule for which
//! pane a wheel belongs to.
//!
//! [`pane`] is the container — an axis given at construction, the way
//! SwiftUI's `ScrollView` takes one, because gpui's is a style field that
//! defaults to unset and gets guessed at. Read its docs before reaching for
//! `div().overflow_y_scroll()`; the guess is a real bug and not a small one.
//!
//! gpui scrolls that pane perfectly well and draws nothing while it does, so a
//! bezel app has no way to show how far down it is. That is [`scrollbar`]: an
//! overlay the caller lays over its own pane, because a wrapper that swallowed
//! the content would have to re-implement layout for it. Nesting two panes is
//! [`claim_wheel`]'s business.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! div().relative()                                  // the bar is absolute in here
//!     .child(
//!         scroll::pane("pane", Axes::Vertical)
//!             .size_full()
//!             .track_scroll(&self.scroll)           // gpui's handle, the app's field
//!             .child(content),
//!     )
//!     .child(scroll::scrollbar("pane-bar", &self.scroll, &self.scroll_bar))
//! ```
//!
//! The bar must span the container it reports on — its track *is* the viewport,
//! in the coordinates [`thumb`] answers in.
//!
//! The geometry is transcribed from zed's own scrollbar (`thumb_ranges` in
//! `crates/ui/src/components/scrollbar.rs`), which is 1722 lines of settings
//! system around the fifteen that matter. Two of gpui's conventions are easy to
//! get backwards and both are load-bearing here: `max_offset` is the *overflow*
//! (content minus viewport, not content), and `offset` is **negative** as you
//! scroll down.
//!
//! [`transient`] is the same bar, shown only while its content moves.
//! [`Overlay`] manages its own state and supports either axis. Its default is
//! [`Visibility::Scrolling`]; [`set_visibility`] updates all default overlays,
//! including Markdown code blocks and tables. [`Viewport`] also owns the handle.
