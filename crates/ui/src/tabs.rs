//! Tabs — an ordered strip of open things, one of them in front.
//!
//! Not [`toggle_group`](crate::widgets::Controls::toggle_group), which picks a
//! value out of a fixed set, and not
//! [`tab_bar`](crate::widgets::Layout::tab_bar), which switches between
//! sections of one page. A tab here has identity: it arrives, it can be closed,
//! it can be dragged past its neighbour, and the strip outlives any particular
//! membership.
//!
//! [`Strip`] is the order and the activation, and imports no gpui — closing,
//! cycling and reordering are `Vec` arithmetic, testable without a window. The
//! paint is [`bar`], [`tab`] and [`close`], with [`drop_mark`] for a drop
//! target and [`Reorder`] for a tab carried along its strip.
//!
//! What a tab *holds* never enters this module. `Id` is the caller's key, and
//! the body it opens is the caller's match on that key.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ui::tabs::bar("panel-tabs").children(self.strip.tabs().iter().map(|id| {
//!     let key = SharedString::from(format!("panel-{id}"));
//!     let state = match self.strip.active() == Some(id) {
//!         true => tabs::State::Focused,
//!         false => tabs::State::Resting,
//!     };
//!     tabs::tab(&theme, key.clone(), self.label(id), state)
//!         .on_click(cx.listener(move |view, _, _, cx| view.show(id, cx)))
