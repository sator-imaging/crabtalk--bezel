//! [`Item`] — a row in a dropped menu — and [`card`], the panel that paints a
//! list of them plus the panels its [`Item::Submenu`] rows drop.
//!
//! Every menu in the system is those two over the caller's own open state: the
//! bar's dropped panel ([`crate::menubar`]), the `···` on a row, the picker
//! under a chip. The state stays with the caller because only it knows what
//! opening means — a [`crate::popover::Popup`] for one, a field for another.
//!
//! [`Cursor`] is the one piece of state the card asks for: which submenus are
//! down and which row is live. Pointer and keyboard both move it, so the two
//! can never disagree about which row an open submenu hangs off. What the
//! pointer did comes back as a [`Hit`]; acting on it stays the caller's.
