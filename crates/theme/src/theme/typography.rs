//! The system type ladder: eleven roles, each carrying a size and a weight.
//!
//! Sizes measured on macOS 26, 2026-08-31, through
//! `NSFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle:)`; line heights 2026-09-01, through
//! `NSLayoutManager.defaultLineHeight(for:)` on the same fonts.
//!
//! One ladder on every platform. An app that wants the host's own body — 9pt
//! Segoe UI is 12px against this 13 — calls [`crate::AppExt::set_base_text_size`], and every
//! role and every metric keyed to it moves together.
