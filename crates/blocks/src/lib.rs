//! Painted fenced blocks for `markdown`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! cx.set_block_renderer(blocks::render);   // once, at boot
//! ```
//!
//! A fence already round trips byte for byte, already holds a caret, and
//! already degrades to its own source where nothing paints it — so a block of
//! an app's own is a renderer over ` ```chart ` rather than a new
//! `markdown::BlockKind`. This crate is one answer to that seam; an app with
//! its own block writes the same function and never depends on this.
//!
//! It is a peer crate rather than a feature on `markdown` for the reason
//! `syntax` is: cargo features are additive across the whole graph, so a
//! `markdown/mermaid` any dependency turned on is one no consumer can turn back
//! off, and a block carrying a parser would break a target nobody asked about.
//! A crate you do not name costs nothing.
//!
//! `markdown` is not a dependency here. A renderer is a fence tag and a string
//! in, an element out, which needs no document model — the consumer's call to
//! `set_block_renderer` is what pins the signature.
