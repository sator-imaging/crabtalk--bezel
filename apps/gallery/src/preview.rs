//! The gallery's link previews, which `markdown` asks for its bookmark blocks.
//!
//! A favicon needs only the host, so every link gets one from a service. A
//! picture and a blurb need the page itself — an HTTP fetch and an HTML parse,
//! which a component gallery has no business carrying — so those come from a
//! table, which is what an app's own cache holds before its fetch lands. A URL
//! the table has never heard of paints its favicon and its host, and that is
//! the honest half-resolved card.
//!
//! The pictures are URLs rather than bundled assets because a card fetching one
//! is the case worth showing: gpui routes a URL-shaped string to
//! `Resource::Uri`, and `with_fallback` covers the times it does not arrive.
