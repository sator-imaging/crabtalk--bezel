//! Where the gallery puts a picture that arrives with no address.
//!
//! A screenshot off the clipboard is bytes and nothing else, so somebody has to
//! choose a place before a document can point at one. That choice is the app's:
//! a real one writes into whatever it saves alongside the document. The gallery
//! saves nothing, so it writes beside the temporary files and hands back the
//! path — enough to paint, and gone with the next reboot.
//!
//! Install with `editor::set_image_store(cx, store::of())`.
