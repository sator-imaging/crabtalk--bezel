//! The gallery's highlighter, which `markdown` asks for its fenced blocks.

//! Native builds call `syntax` and colour any block on the page. A web build
//! cannot: tree-sitter is C, and there is no libc to compile it against for

//! the target is — colours the Syntax page's samples ahead of time, and the
//! browser looks the answer up instead of computing it.
